# Driver API Automation Validation Project (Postman)

## Overview

This project involves validating an API response by creating and executing automated test cases using Postman. The test cases verify the correctness of various fields in the API response to ensure data integrity and consistency. These test cases are scheduled to run on an hour-timer Monday through Friday.
